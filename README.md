# Text Classification for Fault Classification and Maintenance Prediction

**Business Understanding**
The business under review is a UK-based commercial MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) provider in the Aerospace Industry which is faced with the challenge of understanding how its customers' complaints data can be analysed to discover patterns. The aim here is to answer three major business questions which are:
•	What is the correction between the customers’ fault notification and the expert’s maintenance action performed on failed parts?
•	How can the MRO (maintenance repair and overhaul) turn-around time be increased through the prediction of maintenance action?
•	How can the expert action and decision-making for MRO be supported intelligently?

**Data Understanding** 
This project evaluates the possibility of implementing artificial intelligence-based text classification techniques using the historical Fault Log from the MRO service provider, which was derived from their repair shop and compiled by the maintenance expert. The primary enabler for deriving valuable information would be selecting the main features and the appropriate machine learning techniques given the Fault log data. The standard approach adopted in this study is the extraction of the keyword and key phrase for the analysis of the fault notification and maintenance action documents, similarity measurement of these two documents, and then the building of the classification model to classify faults and predict the category of maintenance action. Finally, the performance of classification algorithms applied was evaluated using the F1 score as an effective quantitative metric.
