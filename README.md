# Artificial Intelligence Based Decision Making for Expert Systems-
This repo explores my MSC Data Science research work on Artificial Intelligence Based Decision Making for Expert Systems. 
My goal is to provide support for decision making and maintenance processes through the development of a case classification model for maintenance prediction.
I conducted text analytics to find patterns of parts’ failure and customers' case complaints, measured the relationship between customers’ case complaints and experts’ action using the cosine similarity measure, developed automatic case classification and predictive modelling using machine learning classifiers.
The traditional classifiers and Neural Network classifiers were implemented and the base classifier was chosen based on its high level of accuracy and F1 score.
